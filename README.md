# beocom-bell
This is a brute force method to trigger a Beocom 2 + PSTN to ring, without the use of an actual phone line.

The rigning voltage will be generated using PWM to switch the voltage high/low with a solid state relay.

## Caveats
- Project is currently hardcoded to 25Hz over a 2 second duration. To change this, you'll need to adjust the HZ and duty cycle.

## Hardware Requirements:
1. Aurduino
1. Solid state relay (must handle 100V+)
1. RF Reciever
1. Screw terminal phone jack
1. Project enclosure
1. Optional - Button (this)

##  Ring Voltage
Ring voltage is approx 50V @ 25HZ for 2 seconds (europe). USA is 20Hz.
